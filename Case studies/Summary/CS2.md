# Case Study CS2 

### Description

The project aims to develop a neuro-symbolic chatbot that integrates large language models with an ontology-based knowledge structure. The goal is to provide accurate and context-aware customer support in a highly dynamic business environment, while keeping the system simple and easy to update. By constraining responses through symbolic reasoning, the chatbot reduces hallucinations, improves answer precision, and significantly lowers token usage and operational costs. The solution also decreases the workload of error analysis teams and human customer service agents, who currently handle an unmanageable volume of interactions. A major challenge is maintaining the ontology as commercial events frequently change, without relying on expert ontologists. Therefore, the project explores automatic or low-effort ontology update mechanisms derived from text, ensuring long-term robustness and scalability.

### Goal
The Modeling Value Canvas was used to analyze how conceptual models can support the development of a reliable chatbot in the presence of frequent and unpredictable changes, particularly during sales and promotional events.

### Guiding question

How, and to what extent, is it worthwhile to model dynamic events in a context where no specialists will be available to update the model in the future?

### Particpant profile
- Occupation: PhD Student
- Experience: 1–3 years
- Self-classification: Advanced (High expertise, works independently, guides less experienced modelers, creates complex and accurate models.)
- Modeling Activities: Reading and providing feedback on conceptual models created by others; Creating conceptual models independently; Documenting conceptual models; Updating conceptual models created by someone else.


### Participant comment regarding outcome: 
“I was initially resistant to abandoning the modeling methodology we had been using. However, once I began documenting information directly in the Canvas blocks, I realized its importance. Some colleagues already suspected that our strategy needed to change, and the Canvas made this even clearer. It helped make the discussion easier to understand.”
