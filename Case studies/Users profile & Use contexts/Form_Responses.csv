I feel that filling in the canvas would be more useful to do in advance, in the set-up stages of a project, and not as a reflection task. In my project, we have these moments of reflection quite a lot, even as a regular discussion point in sprints. But, much like in the canvas, we end up rehashing the same points over and over.
The canvas makes distinctions between concepts that are indeed different (pain reliever <--> gain creator, and both of these next to value enabler), but might not be productive to differentiate in practice.
I am filling in the canvas with insights based on my experience as member of a specific team (SPARQL/ontology), so I may not have gotten as much out of it as I/we would have as a full team.
