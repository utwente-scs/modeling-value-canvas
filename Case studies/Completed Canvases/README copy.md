# CS2 

## Description

A PhD student working on a project in a South American financial company, with one to three years of modeling experience and self-classified\footnote{The self-declaration criteria used are presented in the form.} as advanced, used the Canvas to \textit{decide} how conceptual models could support the development of a more reliable chatbot capable of handling dynamic changes during sales events.

## Guiding question

How, and to what extent, is it worthwhile to model dynamic events in a context where no specialists will be available to update the model in the future?

## Participant comment regarding outcome: 
“I was initially resistant to abandoning the modeling methodology we had been using. However, once I began documenting information directly in the Canvas blocks, I realized its importance. Some colleagues already suspected that our strategy needed to change, and the Canvas made this even clearer. It helped make the discussion easier to understand.”
