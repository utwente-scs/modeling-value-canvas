# Case Study CS4 

### Context

.

### Goal
The Modeling Value Canvas was used to justify the use of an ontology for standardizing educational competencies in a collaborative project between universities in Brazil and the Netherlands.

### Guiding question

Why should an ontology be used to standardize competencies in educational scenarios?

### Template
Online

### Completion
Individually

### Participant profile
- Occupation: Assistant professor at a Dutch university
- Experience: +6 years
- Self-classification: Expert (Highly proficient and sought after, handles complex tasks, in-depth understanding of methodologies and tools.)
- Modeling Activities: Reading and providing feedback on conceptual models created by others; Creating conceptual models independently; Documenting conceptual models; Updating conceptual models created by someone else.

### Participant comment regarding the outcome: 
“By using the Canvas, I am forced to be very transparent about the artifacts I’m working with. It is not enough to be familiar with the technology or rely on the implicit knowledge I have from experience. This refinement and discussion add more value to the ultimate goal, which is to justify the modeling project.”
