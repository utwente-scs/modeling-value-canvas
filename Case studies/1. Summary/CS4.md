# Case Study CS4 

### Context

The project focuses on improving the reusability and interoperability of the competency standards defined by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for Information Systems education. Although ACM provides a well-structured competency-based framework in IS2020, its text-only format limits integration across educational programs and tools. To address this, the project develops a machine-interpretable competency dataset that faithfully reproduces the IS2020 standards. The competencies are encoded as an OWL ontology aligned with the Competence Reference Ontology (Core-O), ensuring semantic consistency and cross-domain interoperability. The dataset is created following the Go-Plan FAIRification methodology to enhance findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability.

### Goal
The Modeling Value Canvas was used to justify the use of an ontology for standardizing educational competencies in a collaborative project between universities in Brazil and the Netherlands.

### Guiding question

Why should an ontology be used to standardize competencies in educational scenarios?

### Template
The Canvas was completed online.

### Completion
The Canvas was filled out individually by a member of the project team.

### Participant profile
- Occupation: Assistant professor at a Dutch university
- Experience: +6 years
- Self-classification: Expert (Highly proficient and sought after, handles complex tasks, in-depth understanding of methodologies and tools.)
- Modeling Activities: Reading and providing feedback on conceptual models created by others; Creating conceptual models independently; Documenting conceptual models; Updating conceptual models created by someone else.

### Participant comment regarding the outcome: 
“By using the Canvas, I am forced to be very transparent about the artifacts I’m working with. It is not enough to be familiar with the technology or rely on the implicit knowledge I have from experience. This refinement and discussion add more value to the ultimate goal, which is to justify the modeling project.”
