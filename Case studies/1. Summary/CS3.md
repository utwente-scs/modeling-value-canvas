# Case Study CS3 

### Context

The initiative adopts a model-driven, ontology-based approach to FAIR-aligned semantic interoperability, grounded in semantic traceability for health and life-sciences data. It establishes a shared semantic reference model, defined in OntoUML and implemented as a gUFO-based OWL ontology, which functions as a semantic hub for major standards such as FHIR, OMOP, and openEHR. Rather than relying on numerous technically complex, case-specific mappings, concepts from external standards and schemas are aligned once to HRIO through meaning-centric mapping relations that explicitly capture their intended interpretation. By making these meanings explicit and machine-interpretable, the approach minimizes the risk of false semantic agreement and enables robust, reliable interoperability across systems and domains.

### Goal
The Modeling Value Canvas was used to decide which Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) should demonstrate the value of conceptual modeling in a multi-stakeholder initiative aimed at improving interoperability of health data within the EU.

### Guiding question

Which KPIs should be tracked to evidence the initiative’s value to stakeholders?

### Template
Online

### Completion
Individually

### Participant profile
- Occupation: Modeler at a Dutch company
- Experience: +6 years
- Self-classification: Advanced (High expertise, works independently, guides less experienced modelers, creates complex and accurate models.)
- Modeling Activities: Reading and providing feedback on conceptual models created by others; Creating conceptual models independently; Documenting conceptual models; Updating conceptual models created by someone else.

### Participant comment regarding outcome: 
“The Canvas helped because it forces us to think about how to categorize the information. This prevents a scattered line of thought, since we have to fit each element into the ‘boxes’ and make sure all of them are filled.”
