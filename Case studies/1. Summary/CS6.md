# Case Study CS6 

### Context
The project is a collaborative research initiative focused on advancing federated data infrastructures and AI-driven data use in The Netherlands. It investigates methods to extract, integrate, and analyze distributed authoritative data while respecting ethical principles, data sovereignty, and privacy. A core objective is to improve the trustworthy application of AI, including large language models, by combining them with knowledge graphs to enhance explainability and reduce hallucinations. In parallel, the project designs secure federative and virtual knowledge graph infrastructures that enable cross-organizational data access without data replication. By addressing both intelligent data usage and secure data sharing, the project contributes to more reliable, transparent, and societally beneficial data-driven systems.

### Goal
The Modeling Value Canvas was used to plan improvements to a company’s chatbot, which suffers from issues related to user retention, inaccuracy, and outdated information.

### Guiding question

How can the accuracy of the company’s chatbot be improved?

### Template
The Canvas was completed in person using the printable template.

### Completion
The Canvas was filled out collectively by three members of the project team.

### Participants profile
- Occupation: 1 PhD Student and 2 EngD Students from a Dutch university
- Experience: 1–3 years
- Self-classification: Beginners (Basic understanding, may require guidance, developing expertise, capable of simple models.)
- Modeling Activities: Reading and providing feedback on conceptual models created by others; Creating conceptual models independently; Documenting conceptual models.

### Participants' comments regarding the outcome: 
“I think we got a better picture, and it’s also a good way of communicating and collaborating at the same time.”
“I get the idea that it helps to not overlook certain factors in decision-making.”
“I think it’s a good conversation starter to take what we had here and then work with it.”
