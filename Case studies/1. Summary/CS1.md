# Case Study CS1 

### Context
The project aimed to support the tax department of an international oil company by reducing tax-related errors, lowering operational costs, and improving the tax reporting process through model-driven solutions. An internal IT team developed three complementary applications — a chatbot, a semantic search engine, and a tax prediction system — supported by a shared semantic foundation. This foundation consisted of an OntoUML conceptual model, an OWL ontology, and detailed documentation. In addition to enabling the technical solutions, these artifacts provided benefits such as improved knowledge sharing and support for personnel training, by making tax concepts and processes explicit and consistently represented.

### Goal
The Modeling Value Canvas was used to reflect on the development and use of the OntoUML conceptual model, the OWL ontology, and the supporting documentation, with the aim of assessing the value they provided throughout the project lifecycle.

### Guiding question

Was creating the modeling solutions to support the applications’ development a worthwhile investment?

### Particpant profile
- Occupation: PhD Student
- Experience: 1–3 years
- Self-classification: Intermediate (Good grasp of concepts and tools, works independently on many tasks, creates moderately complex models.)
- Modeling Activities: Reading and providing feedback on conceptual models created by others; Creating conceptual models independently; Documenting conceptual models; Updating conceptual models created by someone else.
