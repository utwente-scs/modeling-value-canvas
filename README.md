# Modeling Value Canvas 

This repository provides the support material and real-world examples that accompany the Modeling Value Canvas and guide its practical use.

The Modeling Value Canvas is a theory-informed tool designed to help practitioners and researchers assess and communicate the value of domain modeling. It offers a systematic structure to:

- decide whether, what, and how to model,
- plan and justify modeling initiatives, and
- reflect on the outcomes and value of modeling work.

The Canvas was evaluated in six real-world case studies with modelers in diverse roles, including consultants, academics, and practitioners with varying levels of modeling expertise. The results show that the tool is:

- Useful across all evaluated cases,
- Helpful for externalizing assumptions, organizing complex information, and comparing alternatives,
- Effective in improving decision quality, highlighting risks and dependencies, and supporting clearer communication with stakeholders, and
- Perceived as engaging and reusable, with participants expressing strong intentions to apply and recommend it in future work.
